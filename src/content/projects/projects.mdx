# Latest Projects

## Vicharak Vaaman SBC
Led the BSP development for Vicharak's Vaaman Single Board Computer (RK3399-based). Managed device tree configurations, U-Boot bootloader integration, and Linux kernel customizations.

## Custom ROM & Kernel Development
Extensive work on custom ROM and kernel development for Xiaomi devices, including Redmi K20 Pro, Mi 11X, Mi 12X, and Poco F2/F3. Focused on optimizing performance and power management for Qualcomm Snapdragon platforms.

```c
/* Example of a kernel power management function */
static int __maybe_unused xiaomi_suspend(struct device *dev)
{
    struct xiaomi_device *xdev = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
    int ret;

    /* Disable clock before suspending */
    ret = clk_disable_unprepare(xdev->clk);
    if (ret)
        dev_err(dev, "Failed to disable clock during suspend: %d\n", ret);

    /* Put the device into low power state */
    ret = regulator_disable(xdev->vdd);
    if (ret)
        dev_err(dev, "Failed to disable regulator during suspend: %d\n", ret);

    return ret;
}
```

## Linux BSP Development
Freelance work on multiple projects involving BSP development, Linux kernel customization, and device driver integration for platforms like Qualcomm Snapdragon, Raspberry Pi, and Rockchip SoCs.

Example device tree configuration for a custom board:

```dts
/* Simplified device tree for RK3399 board */
/ {
    compatible = "vicharak,vaaman", "rockchip,rk3399";
    
    memory@0 {
        device_type = "memory";
        reg = <0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0x80000000>;
    };

    chosen {
        stdout-path = "serial2:1500000n8";
        bootargs = "earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0xff1a0000 console=ttyS2,1500000n8 swiotlb=1 coherent_pool=1m";
    };
    
    /* SoC configuration and peripherals */
    soc {
        uart2: serial@ff1a0000 {
            compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-uart", "snps,dw-apb-uart";
            reg = <0x0 0xff1a0000 0x0 0x100>;
            interrupts = <101 4>;
            clocks = <&cru 128>, <&cru 129>;
            clock-names = "baudclk", "apb_pclk";
            pinctrl-names = "default";
            pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_xfer>;
            status = "okay";
        };
    };
}
```

## Open Source Contributions
Actively contributing to various open source projects in the Linux ecosystem, with a focus on improving hardware support for ARM-based platforms and optimizing kernel performance.

### Linux Kernel
Submitted patches for device drivers and BSP improvements.

### U-Boot
Worked on bootloader customizations for various embedded platforms.
