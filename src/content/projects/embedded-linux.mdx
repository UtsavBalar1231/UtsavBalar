# Embedded Linux Development

This project involved creating a custom Linux distribution for industrial IoT devices using the Yocto Project and Buildroot.

## Objectives

- Create a minimal, secure Linux distribution for resource-constrained devices
- Develop custom device drivers for specialized hardware
- Implement over-the-air update mechanisms
- Optimize boot time and system performance

## Implementation

The system was built using Yocto Project with custom meta-layers for specific hardware components. Key components included:

```bash
# Example layered architecture
├── meta-core           # Base system components
├── meta-hardware       # Hardware-specific BSP
│   ├── meta-rockchip   # Rockchip SoC support
│   ├── meta-sensors    # Custom sensor drivers
├── meta-security       # Security hardening features
├── meta-ota            # Over-the-air update system
└── meta-application    # Application-specific components
```

## Device Tree Configuration

A crucial part of the project was proper device tree configuration:

```c
// Simplified device tree example
/ {
    compatible = "vendor,device";
    #address-cells = <2>;
    #size-cells = <2>;

    cpus {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        cpu@0 {
            device_type = "cpu";
            compatible = "arm,cortex-a53";
            reg = <0x0>;
        };
        // More CPUs...
    };

    soc {
        compatible = "simple-bus";
        #address-cells = <2>;
        #size-cells = <2>;
        ranges;

        i2c0: i2c@ff660000 {
            compatible = "vendor,i2c";
            reg = <0x0 0xff660000 0x0 0x1000>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 61 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
            clocks = <&cru SCLK_I2C0>;
            clock-names = "i2c";
            pinctrl-names = "default";
            pinctrl-0 = <&i2c0_pins>;
            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <0>;
            status = "disabled";
        };
        
        // More devices...
    };
};
```

## Results

The final system achieved:

- Boot time under 3 seconds
- Secure boot with hardware root of trust
- Seamless OTA updates with rollback protection
- Power consumption optimized for battery operation
